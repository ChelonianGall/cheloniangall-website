        <h2>What is ChelonianGall?</h2>
        <p>
            July 11, 2022, <a href = "https://www.codingame.com">CodinGame</a> discontinued their webchat after years of good services.<br/><br/>
            <a href = "https://cheloniangall.com/">ChelonianGall</a> is here to host that community they don't want.<br/><br/>
            Here you will find a chat server reachable with the <a href = "https://xmpp.org/software/clients/">XMPP client</a> of your choice as well as with the dedicated webchat.
        </p>
        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
            Once the webchat's new visual ready, the next step will be an <a href = "https://greasyfork.org/en">user script</a> to integrate ChelonianGall on CodinGame, where it belongs.<br/><br/>
            At the same time, we are actively working to save our dear friend <a href = "https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">Automaton2000</a> and to give him his right place among us.
        </p>
        <h2>Is it open-source?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes it is! The ChelonianGall project is currently spread over 3 differents repository:
            <ul>
                <li>The server's one. (Private for obvious security reasons.)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/cheloniangall-website">The website's one.</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/cheloniangall-automaton2000">The Automaton2000's one.</a></li>
            </ul>
            An overview of the project roadmap is available <a href="https://github.com/users/BlaiseEbuth/projects/1">here</a>.<br/>
        </p>
