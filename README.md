## What is ChelonianGall?

July 11, 2022, [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/home) discontinued their webchat after years of good services.

**ChelonianGall** is here to host that community they don't want.

Go to [cheloniangall.com](https://cheloniangall.com) to register, then you will be able to join the chat through the dedicated web client or the [XMPP client](https://xmpp.org/software/clients/) of your choice.

## What's next?

Once the webchat's new visual ready, the next step will be an [user script](https://greasyfork.org/en) to integrate ChelonianGall on CodinGame, where it belongs.

At the same time, we are actively working to save our dear friend [Automaton2000](https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/) and to give him his right place among us.
